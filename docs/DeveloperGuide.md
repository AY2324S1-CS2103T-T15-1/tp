## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the F.A.K.E.J.A.R.V.I.S. data i.e., all `Person`, `Task`, `Session`, `GradedTest` and `Consultation` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `TaskList`, `SessionList`, `GradedTestList` and `ConsultationList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Task`, `Session`, `GradedTest` and `Consultation` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both F.A.K.E.J.A.R.V.I.S. data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `ConsultationListStorage`, `GradedTestListStorage`, `SessionListStorage`, `TaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* contains data that is separated into distinct files, each catering to specific functionalities, which minimises the impact of potential corruption. Corruption in one set of data does not propagate to others, reinforcing the integrity of the data.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sessions
The Session component consists of the following set of features: Create Session

#### The Session class
The Session Class encompasses several important attributes:
* `SessionNumber`: This unique identifier helps distinguish one session from another. It is an integral part of the Session class and is a primary key when searching for or referencing sessions within the system.

* `SessionStudents`: An essential component of every session is the list of students participating. The SessionStudents class keeps track of the students present in a particular session. This class allows for efficient management of attendance records and plays a vital role in generating attendance reports.

* `SessionRemark`: Sometimes, additional information about a session is necessary, such as special instructions, topics covered, or any other relevant remarks. The SessionRemark field offers the flexibility to include such notes.

The Session class also provides a set of getter methods that enable access to these attributes. For instance, you can retrieve the session number, list of students, or session remarks using these methods.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Session` and its respective fields.

![Session Class UML](images/SessionClassUML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How the students are added to a session upon initialisation:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `CreateSession` feature takes in arguments of varying number of student names.
- Pros:This choice offers a high degree of flexibility when it comes to adding students to a session. You can add any number of students when creating a session, which is essential for accommodating different class sizes and situations.
**Alternative 2:** An alternative design could involve creating two separate constructor methods within the `CreateSession` class. One constructor would be responsible for adding a student to an existing `SessionStudents`, and the other would take an entire `SessionStudents` object as an argument.
- Cons: This alternative introduces additional complexity in terms of validating user input and checking for null values upon execution. It may be less intuitive than the current approach.

By opting for the current choice (Alternative 1), the implementation remains straightforward and user-friendly, allowing for versatile usage scenarios. It ensures that users can efficiently create sessions and add students to them without unnecessary constraints or complications.

**Key Takeaway:** The chosen approach in the implementation of the `CreateSession` feature prioritises flexibility and ease of use for users, providing a more intuitive experience when managing class sessions and student attendance.

### Tasks
The Task component consists of the following set of features: Add Task, Delete Task and Update Progress.

#### The Task class
The Task Class is made up of a `TaskName`, `TaskDescription`, `date`, `TaskPriority`, `TaskProgress`, and a set of getter methods that corresponds to these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Task` and its respective fields.

![Task Class UML](images/TaskClassUML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How the status of a task is implemented:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `TaskProgress` Enum for Task Progress. Progress includes `not_started`, `pending`, `done`.
- Pros: This choice offers flexibility in representing task progress.
- Cons: It requires additional checks to validate user input and extensive unit testing.

**Alternative 2:** `isDone` Boolean for Task Completion.
- Cons: Only allows for a binary state, i.e., either the task is done or not.

### Assignments
The Assignment component consists of the following set of features: View Assignments, Edit Grade, Delete Grade, Edit Comment and Delete Comment.

#### The Assignment class
The Assignment Class is made up of an `assignmentName`, `grade`, `comment`, and a set of getter methods that corresponds to most of these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Assignment` and its respective fields.

![Assignment Class UML](images/AssignmentClass.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How an assignment in being assigned to a person:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `AssignmentMap` is a field in `Person` that contains `Assignment` instances which are assigned to that person.
- Pros: This choice makes it easier to ensure that each assignment is only being assigned to one person, and also makes it easier to manage multiple features related to an assignment.
- Cons: It requires additional time to access an assignment since the assignment needs to be obtained from the correct person first.

**Alternative 2:** Create a `PersonList` field in every `Assignment`, which contains `Person` instances.
- Cons: Every person related command will have to update `PersonList` in every `Assignment` instance.

**Alternative 3:** Create a `PersonList` field in every `Assignment`, and an `AssignmentMap` field in every `Person`.
- Cons: It increases coupling which increases the dependency of the classes.

### GradedTest
The GradedTest component is responsible for tracking and managing graded test scores of individuals. It includes features such as creating and updating graded test scores.

#### The GradedTest class
The GradedTest Class is made up of a `ReadingAssessment1`, `ReadingAssessment2`, `MidTerms`, `Finals`, and
`PracticalExam`, each representing a different aspect of an individual's graded test scores. GradedTest Class also have a set of getter methods that corresponds to those fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Task` and its respective fields.

![GradedTest Class UML](images/GradedTest.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How to represent the scores of individuals:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilizing `String` for individual graded test score.
- Pros: This choice offers flexibility in representing graded tests (e.g Default value of `-`).
- Cons: It requires additional parsing to generate statistics of how the Avenger's students are doing (e.g average,
  highest, lowest score).

**Alternative 2:** Multiple constructors for `GradedTest`.
- Pros: Provides flexibility in how users can create a `GradedTest` object.
- Cons: Requires additional parsing. Different constructor will give different error messages.


### Consultations

The Consultation component consists fo the following set of features: Create Consultation, Delete Consultation, Add
Student to a Consultation.

#### The Consultation Class

The Consultation Class is made up of a `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, a `HashSet` of `Person` and a set of getter methods
that corresponds to these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Consultation` and its respective fields.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ConsultationClassUMLDiagram.png"></p>
<p align="center">Consultation Class UML Diagram</p>

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How the students are stored to a consultation:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use Set<Person> to keep track of students in a consultation.
    * Pros: Stores only 1 instance of a unique person, no duplicates.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.


* **Alternative 2:** Use ArrayList<Person> to keep track of students.
    * Cons: We must ensure there are no duplicates with additional checks.

**Aspect: Adding students to a new or existing consultation:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** The `AddToConsult` feature creates a new Consultation object with updated student list
  * Pros: Defensive programming when entirely creating a new Consultation object without modifying previous object.
  * Cons: Require additional checking to inform exception cases.

* **Alternative 2:** `AddToConsult` directly manipulate the attribute `students` in a Consultation object.
  * Cons: Poor abstraction and room for errors.


### Commands
This section explains the general implementation of all commands.

The following activity diagram generally shows the overall flow of events that the user will experience.


[//]: # (INSERT ACTVITY DIAGRAM HERE)



#### Parser Commands
This section explains the implementation and execution of commands that have their own specific parser.

Below is the sequence diagram for the execution of these commands (denoted by `XYZCommand`) after user input is sent to `LogicManager`. The execution of each of the command has been omitted due to their inherent differences and will be covered in their respective command sections below.

![Command Parser Sequence Diagram](images/CommandsParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The user enters a command with the necessary parameters which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2:
The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` for it to identify the type of command.

Step 3:
The `AddressBookParser` parses the user input and creates a command parser for that specific command. (denoted by `XYZCommandParser`)

Step 4:
The command parser is returned to the `AddressBookParser` which then calls `XYZCommandParser::parse` to parse the additional parameters.

Step 5:
The `XYZCommandParser` creates its respective command object (denoted by `XYZCommand`) and returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6:
The `LogicManager` calls `XYZCommand::execute` where the interaction between the command and the model is handled.

Step 7:
The `XYZCommand` creates a successful `CommandResult` and returns it to the UI.


#### Students

#### Edit Student Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Edit Student feature via the `edit` command. The `EditCommand` updates the fields of the existing specified `Person`. There is 1 compulsory field, which is the Index of the `Person` to update. However, at least 1 optional field must also be provided. The optional fields are name, phone, telegram handle, tag and graded tests.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of the `EditCommand`.

![Edit Command Sequence Diagram](images/EditStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `EditCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::getFilteredPersonList` and `List<Person>::get` to get the specified `Person` to edit.

Step 2:
The `EditCommand::createEditedPerson` is invoked to create a new immutable `Person` object with the updated fields.

Step 3:
The `EditCommand` will call `setPerson` in `Model` to replace the original `Person` with the new `Person` object.

Step 4:
The `Model` will also call `setStudent` in the respective lists (denoted by `List<XYZ>`, where XYZ refers to `Consultation` and `Session`) to update the relevant lists containing the original `Person` to the new `Person` object.

Step 5:
The `EditCommand` will call its own `updateFilteredPersonList` method to update the model's filter and display all the students to the user.

Step 6:
The `EditCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.



#### Delete Student Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Delete Student feature via the `delete` command.
The `DeleteCommand` causes the specified `Person` to be deleted from the application. This includes removing the student from any `consultations` or `sessions` that the student might be in.

This process is summarised in the activity diagram below

![Delete Activity Diagram](images/DeleteStudentActivityDiagram.png)

#### Create Session Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Create Session feature via the `createsession` command.
The `CreateSessionCommand` causes the specified `Session` to be added to the Session List in the application.
There are two compulsory fields which are the session number of the session, as well as the names of the students involved.

Below is the activity diagram outlining the execution of `CreateSessionCommand`.

![CreateSessionCommand activity diagram](images/CreateSessionActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The Avenger(user) enters the command `createsession` and the command is parsed by the `CreateSessionCommandParser`.

Step 2:
The Session Number parameter is checked for its validity, which will display an error message if invalid. Otherwise, a Session with that session number is temporarily created.

Step 3:
The given name(s) of students are then checked if they exist in the Address Book. If there are any invalid names, an error message indicating Student Not Found will be displayed. Otherwise, another check follows.

Step 4:
The final check ensures that there are no duplicate sessions being created, before finally adding the created session to the model. If a duplicate session is detected, an error message will be displayed to alert the Avenger that a duplicate session will be created.

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How to determine if a session is considered a duplicate**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Session is considered duplicate if another session with the same session number already exists in the session list.
    * Pros: It is easier to manage the duplicate session situation if only session number is compared, making other features easier to implement by referring to the session number as the session's identity.
    * Cons: User will not be able to have multiple sessions of the same session number.

* **Alternative 2:** Session will be considered duplicate only if all of its fields, session number, students, and session remark are equal.
    * Pros: It allows for multiple sessions of the same session number to be stored in the same session list.
    * Cons: A small mistake in the inputs will cause two sessions to not be considered duplicate, which could unintentionally lead to multiple sessions with almost the same fields (which would have been considered duplicate otherwise).


#### Take Attendance Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Take Attendance feature via the `takeattendance` command.
The `TakeAttendanceCommand` causes the specified `Person` to be added to the specified session. 
There are two compulsory fields, which are the session number of the session, as well as the names of the students involved.

This process is shown in the sequence diagram below

![Take Attendance Activity Diagram](images/TakeAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `TakeAttendanceCommand::execute`, which then calls `Model::findSessionBySessionNumber` to retrieve the specified session to be updated.

Step 2:
The `TakeAttendanceCommand` then updates the attendance status based on the provided information, utilising the `Model::getMatchingStudentName` to obtain the corresponding `Person` object to be updated.

Step 3:
The `TakeAttendanceCommand` creates an updated `Session` object using the `createUpdatedSession` method, which is saved in the `Model` using `Model::setSession`.

Step 4:
Finally, the `TakeAttendanceCommand` triggers the `Model` to update the filtered session list using the `updateFilteredSessionList` to display all sessions.


#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How models are modified to store changes**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Cause updates to both `Session` and `Person` when updating the attendance status of a student to a specified session.
    * Pros: Allows for ease of future enhancements since we can cause the same update from either `Session` or `Person` involved.
    * Cons: The same action is performed twice, but since the student is added to a `StudentSet`, only one instance of student is added.

* **Alternative 2:** Only update the `Session` to store the `Person`
    * Pros: The same action is not performed twice.
    * Cons: It may be difficult to add future enhancements without this method in place as a skeleton.


#### Add Tasks Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Add Task feature via the `addtask` command.
The `AddTaskCommand` causes the specified `Task` to be added to the Task List in the application.
There is only one compulsory field which is the name of the task. There are several optional fields such as the description, priority and deadline.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `AddTaskCommand`.

![AddTaskCommand sequence diagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `AddTaskCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::addTask` to add the new task into the task list.

Step 2:
The `Model` will call its own `updateFilteredTaskList` method to update the model's filter and display all the tasks to the user.

Step 3:
The `AddTaskCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.


##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the AddTaskCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let the `LogicManager` pass the model to the command to execute.
    * Pros: Promotes information hiding since we do not need to expose the model to the `AddTaskCommand`.


* **Alternative 2:** Store the model in the `AddTaskCommand` itself.
    * Pros: Easier to debug.
    * Cons: The `AddTaskCommand` might be able to call other methods in the model.


#### Delete Tasks Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Delete Task feature via the `deletetask` command. The `DeleteTaskCommand` causes the specified `Task` identified using the `Index` to be deleted from the Task List in the application. There is one compulsory field which is the Index of the Task to delete. 

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `DeleteTaskCommand`.

![DeleteTaskCommand Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `DeleteTaskCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::getFilteredTaskList` and `List<Task>::get` to get the relevant task to be deleted.

Step 2:
The `Model` then calls `deleteTask` to remove the specified task from the task list.

Step 3:
The `DeleteTaskCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.


##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the DeleteTaskCommand:**
* Similar to the `AddTaskCommand`, the main considerations for this command is related to the way that the model is stored.



#### View Tasks Feature
This section explains the implementation of the View Tasks feature via the `viewtasks` command. The `ViewTasksCommand` displays the Tasks filtered using the `predicate` specified by the user. There are multiple optional fields that the user can use to filter the list by, such as the progress, priority, name, description and date. However, only one field is able to be applied as a filter at a specific time. 

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `ViewTasksCommand`.

![ViewTaskCommand Sequence Diagram](images/ViewTasksSequenceDiagram.png)


Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `ViewTasksCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::updateFilteredTaskList` with the given `Predicate<Task>`.

Step 2:
The `ViewTasksCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.

##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the ViewTasksCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Combine the list and find functionality into one.
    * Pros: Promotes user experience due to the reduction in the number of different commands.
    * Cons: More checks need to be done to ensure that the correct predicate is applied and the correct field is being checked against. 

* **Alternative 2:** Separate out into 2 separate functions.
    * Pros: Easier to debug since they're implemented independently of one another.
    * Cons: More commands make the interface messier, negatively impacting user experience.


#### Update Task Progress Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Update Task Progress feature via the `updateprogress` command. The `UpdateTasksProgressCommand` updates the progress of the task identified using the Index. There are 2 compulsory fields, which are the Index of the task to update, and the new progress status of the task. The progress must be one of the 3 values: `not_started`, `pending`, `done`.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `UpdateTasksProgressCommand`.

![UpdateTasksProgressCommand Sequence Diagram](images/UpdateTaskProgressSequenceDiagram.png)


Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `UpdateTaskProgressCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::getFilteredTaskList` and `List<Task>::get` to get the relevant task to be edited.

Step 2:
The `UpdateTaskProgressCommand::createTask` is invoked to create a new immutable Task object with the updated progress.

Step 3:
The `UpdateTaskProgressCommand` will call `setTask` in `Model` to replace the existing `Task` with the new `Task` object.

Step 4:
The `UpdateTaskProgressCommand` will call its own `updateFilteredTaskList` method to update the model's filter and display all the tasks to the user.

Step 5:
The `UpdateTaskProgressCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.



##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the UpdateTasksProgressCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new immutable object of the Task and replace the previous Task with the new Task.
    * Pros: Easier to debug since the state of immutable objects cannot be changed.
    * Cons: Performance degradation due to the need to create new objects everytime the Task is updated.

* **Alternative 2:** Mutate the existing Task in the Task list to reflect the new progress.
    * Cons: Risk of the state of mutable objects being changed by other methods or processes.
    * Cons: Reduced maintainability as state of object can keep changing throughout the code.



#### View Assignments Feature
This section explains the implementation of the View Assignments feature via the `viewassignments` command. The `ViewAssignmentsCommand` displays a list of Assignments belonging to a Student identified using the `STUDENT_INDEX` field. There is one compulsory field which is the Index of the Student to be selected.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `ViewAssignmentsCommand`.

![ViewAssignmentsCommand Sequence Diagram](images/ViewAssignmentsSequenceDiagram.png)


Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `ViewAssignmentsCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::getFilteredPersonList` and List<Person>::get to get the specified Student.

Step 2:
The `ViewAssignmentsCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.

##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the ViewAssignmentsCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let LogicManager store the Index of the Student whose Assignments are going to be displayed.
    * Pros: Enables the list of Assignments to automatically be updated every time the Assignment Grade or Comment is being edited or deleted.
    * Cons: The command details are not fully handled inside ViewAssignmentsCommand, resulting in poor separation of concerns principle.

* **Alternative 2:** Let LogicManager store the list of Assignments belonging to the Student whose Assignments are going to be displayed.
    * Pros: Abides by the separation of concerns principle better.
    * Cons: When the user edits or deletes an Assignment's Grade or Comment, he has to keep typing `viewassignments` to see the list of Assignments getting updated. This negatively impacts the user experience.



#### Edit Grade Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Edit Grade feature via the `editgrade` command. The `EditGradeCommand` edits the Grade of an Assignment belonging to a Student identified using the `STUDENT_INDEX` field. The Assignment is identified using the `ASSIGNMENT_NAME` field. There are three compulsory fields which are the Index of the Student to be selected, the name of the Assignment and the new Grade of the Assignment.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `EditGradeCommand`.

![EditGradeCommand Sequence Diagram](images/EditGradeSequenceDiagram.png)


Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `ViewAssignmentsCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::getFilteredPersonList` and `List<Person>::get` to get the specified Student.

Step 2:
The `EditGradeCommand::createGradedPerson` is invoked to create a new immutable Person object with the updated Assignment Grade.

Step 3:
The `EditGradeCommand` will call `setPerson` in `Model` to replace the original `Person` with the new `Person` object.

Step 4:
The `Model` will also call `setStudent` in the respective lists (denoted by `List<XYZ>`, where XYZ refers to `Consultation` and `Session`) to update the relevant lists containing the original `Person` to the new `Person` object.

Step 5:
The `EditGradeCommand` will call its own `updateFilteredPersonList` method to update the model's filter and display all the students to the user.

Step 6:
The `EditGradeCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.

##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we edit the Grade of a `Person` object's Assignment:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a completely new instance of `Person`.
  * Pros: Enables the `Person` object to remain immutable.
  * Cons: Editing the Grade of an Assignment will keep changing the `Person` found in the Model.

* **Alternative 2:** Update the `Assignment` found in the `Person` object.
  * Pros: Simplifies the process of editing the Grade.
  * Cons: Causes the `Person` object to no longer be immutable, giving rise to potential bugs or complications.



#### Create Consultation Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Create Consultation feature via the `createconsult` command.
The `CreateConsultCommand` creates a `Consultation` and adds it into the Consultation List in the application.
There are multiple compulsory field: date, time and name of students. 

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `CreateConsultCommand`.

![CreateConsultCommand sequence diagram](images/CreateConsultSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `CreateConsult::execute`, which in turn creates a new `StudentSet`.

Step 2:
Then, `Model::getMatchingStudentName` is called in a loop to add `Person` specified by name into the `StudentSet`.

Step 3:
A new `Consultation` is created with specified date, time and the new `StudentSet`.

Step 4:
`Model::addConsultation` is then called to add the newly created `Consultation`.

Step 5:
The `CreateConsultCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.


##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the CreateConsultCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let the `LogicManager` pass the model to the command to execute.
    * Pros: Promotes information hiding since we do not need to expose the model to the `CreateConsultCommand`.


* **Alternative 2:** Store the model in the `CreateConsultCommand` itself.
    * Pros: Easier to debug.
    * Cons: The `CreateConsultCommand` might be able to call other methods in the model.



#### Add To Consultation Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Add To Consultation feature via the `addtoconsult` command.
The `AddToConsultCommand` adds a new student to the consultation identified using the Index.
There are 2 compulsory field, which are the Index of the consultation to add student into, and the name of the student.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `AddToConsultCommand`.

![AddToConsult sequence diagram](images/AddToConsultSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `AddToConsultCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::getFilteredConsultationList` and `List<Consultation>::get` to get the relevant consultation to be edited.

Step 2:
The `AddToConsultCommand::createUpdatedConsultation` is invoked to create a new immutable Consultation object with the updated `StudentSet`.

Step 3:
The `AddToConsultCommand` will call `setConsultation` in `Model` to replace the existing `Consultation` with the new `Consultation` object.

Step 4:
The `AddToConsultCommand` will call its own `updateFilteredConsultationList` method to update the model's filter and display all the consultation to the user.

Step 5:
The `AddToConsultCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.


##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the AddToConsultCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new immutable object of the updated Consultation and replace the previous Consultation.
    * Pros: Easier to debug since the state of immutable objects cannot be changed.
    * Cons: Performance overhead due creating new objects everytime the Consultation is edited.

* **Alternative 2:** Mutate the existing Consultation in the Consultation list to reflect the new students added.
    * Cons: Risk of the state of mutable objects being changed by other methods or processes.
    * Cons: Reduced maintainability as state of object can keep changing throughout the code.
